Analyzed multiple years of stock data using VBA-Excel. Created a script from stock data in years 2018 to 2020 analyzing yearly change in price, percentage change, and total volume. Each year includes the following information:

    -The ticker symbol
    -Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    -The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    -The total stock volume of the stock

I added functionality to script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". Screenshots of results are below.
