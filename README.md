Purpose was too analyze multiple years of stock data using VBA-Excel. I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
 -The ticker symbol
 -Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
 -The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
 -The total stock volume of the stock.
In addition, I also added functionality to script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". Screenshots of results are below.
